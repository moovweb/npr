# NPR

The NPR sample project illustrates how to use Moovweb to create a header for a site. In this case, we will use the [NPR homepage](http://npr.org) to illustrate this.

You can follow how to create this project with Moovweb's [starting mobile sites tutorial](http://console.moovweb.com/learn/training/mobile/mobile_site).

## Basics

This project works with Moovweb's development framework. To get it running, navigate to the folder in your command line and start the server with the command: `sudo moov server --auto-hosts`.

See detailed documentaion at [the Moovweb site](http://console.moovweb.com).
